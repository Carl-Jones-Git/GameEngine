## Design Philosophy

### Direct Public Access Pattern
Following common practice in game engines and mathematics libraries, many classes in this engine use public member variables accessed directly rather than getter/setter methods. This design choice offers several advantages:

**Performance Benefits:**
- Eliminates function call overhead for frequently accessed data (critical when processing thousands of objects per frame)
- Enables better compiler optimizations and more predictable memory access patterns
- Reduces cache misses when working with arrays of objects like vertices or particles

**Development Efficiency:**
- Simplifies debugging by allowing direct inspection and modification of values
- Reduces boilerplate code for simple data containers like Vector3, Color, or Transform classes
- Enables faster prototyping and iteration during development

This approach is used selectively for simple data structures and mathematical types, while complex systems that require validation or coordination still use proper encapsulation.

## Example Game: Go-Kart Racing

The included go-kart racing game demonstrates all engine features in action across multiple platforms:

### Platform Support
- **PC Version** (`KartingPC/`) - Full-featured desktop implementation
- **Xbox One Version** (`KartingXBoxOne/`) - Console-optimized build

## Runtime
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/Carl-Jones-Git/GameEngine.git
   ```
2. **Run DX11Proj.exe:**
    - Navigate to the "DX11_Karting - Windows11_Runtime" folder and run DX11Proj.exe

## Building

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/Carl-Jones-Git/GameEngine.git
   ```
   
2. **Open the solution in Visual Studio:**
   - Navigate to the desired solution folder (KartingPC or KartingXBoxOne)
   - Open the `.sln` file with Visual Studio 2022 or later
   - To build for KartingXBoxOne navigate to Includes.h and comment #define PC_BUILD

4. **Restore NuGet packages:**
   - Right-click on the solution in Solution Explorer
   - Select "Restore NuGet Packages"
   - Wait for all packages to download and install

5. **Set build configuration:**
